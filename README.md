### Hi there, my name is Rouben Ghambaryan!

I am once a student of Psychology turned Software Engineer. As a student of App Academy, a 6-month full stack development bootcamp, I put in hard work and dedication to learn and craft tools such as, React | Redux | Python | Node.js | Express | Sequelize | PostgreSQL | SQLAlchemy | Git | Javascript | HTML | CSS. Along my journey at App Academy I got a chance to pair-program nearly everyday. Ultimately this experienced allowed me to become a good coder, and an even better team player! Apart from being a Software Engineer, my passions include playing video games, reading books, and watching shows!
